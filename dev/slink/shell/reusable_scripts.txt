# On how to write resuable scripts

* how to bind functions defined in script to local scope, or howto import
  functions to a shell script, so you can make a function both public and
  private this way.

* put each functionality reached by a command to seperate files

* make a name.lib that loads them

* package functions with same purpose to a directory named name.lib

* create a function import that searches a name.lib directory and loads scripts
  in it

* i'd like to use command "import" (java, python) but that's an already taken
  name by imagemagick, so "include" may be a good choice (c, php), hence it's
  really get included

* you may create files with name libary.lib that are not real packages but a
  good group of useful functions needed for a specific task. make command
  "include" to handle these meta packages.

* there may be both library.lib as file and directory. In that situation, first
  process liblary.lib which may resolve package dependences, set aliases, or
  anything. (**extX alatt ilyen nincs**)

* support the "include library.*" to include a whole package or only specific
  scripts
