<h1>Sport floorings Installation - cleaning - maintenance</h1>

<h2>Floor coating</h2>
<p>The Graboplast heterogeneous vinyl floor coating is available in rolls and should be stored according to this manual. The rolls must be stored upright (vertically); the material or pallets must not be piled up on top of each other. The product must be stored in the original packaging (as delivered).</p>
<h2>Welding Rod</h2>
<p>Graboheg welding rod should be stored under the same conditions as the floor. The individual units must be stored in the original packaging (as delivered).</p>
<h2>Storage </h2>
<p>The product should be stored in a cool, dry and well ventilated place where it is not exposed to dust. The product should not be stored outdoors, even if it is covered.</p>
<h2>Temperature</h2>
<p>PVC products should be stored at temperatures between +10&deg;C and +25&deg;C and only briefly at temperatures higher than this.</p>
<h2>Humidity</h2>
<p>Storage in damp locations and exposure to condensation must be avoided. A relative humidity of about 40 - 67% is preferable.</p>
<h2>Heating</h2>
<p>In heated storage locations, PVC products must be protected from the heat source. The distance between the heat source and stored product must be at least 1 metre.</p>
<h2>Light</h2>
<p>The products must be protected from light, particularly from direct sunlight and artificial light with a high ultraviolet component. Lighting with standard lamps is preferable.</p>
<h2>Storage and handling</h2>
<p>The products must be stored stress-free, i.e. without being subjected to tension, pressure or other deformations as stresses can encourage both permanent deformation and the formation of cracks.</p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p>With correct storage and handling, the properties of PVC products remain practically unchanged over a long period (appr. 4-5 years)</p>
<h1>Subfloor requirements</h1>
<p>The subfloor must be clean, permanently dry, perfectly smooth and free of cracks and anti- adhesion materials. In the case of concrete subfloors the moisture content must not exceed  2,5 CM %, in  case of anhydride ( plaster) 0,5 CM%.</p>
<p>In terms of subfloor quality, it is strongly recommended &ndash; before laying &ndash;  to make the necessary tests and surveys. It is advisable to have the results documented.</p>
<p>The loose cover-layer on the concrete surface must be eliminated by grinding. After dust- proofing, the concrete subfloor must be pre-treated with primer. Application of subfloor levelling should be started only after the primer has been completely absorbed.</p>

<h1>Laying the floor covering</h1>
<p>The Grabo floor coverings must be unrolled and tempered at the place of laying a minimum of 24 hours before laying, at least at 18 oC. After the floor covering has been relaxed, it must be cut with a few centimetres excess left at each end. The edges should be fitted and laid precisely next to each other.</p>
<p>Before gluing, the laid-out flooring should be tucked half way back. Following this, starting from the centre, the adhesive should be applied to the subfloor using a toothed spreading plate.</p>
<p>In case of an absorbent subfloor, Graboplast suggests using water-dispersion adhesives (for example Thomsit UK 400), which are environmentally friendly and are not harmful to health. In the case of a non absorbent subfloor it is recommended that contact adhesives be used (for example Thomsit K 188 E). Always follow the instructions of the adhesive producer.</p>
<p>In the interest of good adhesion, the floor covering &ndash; starting from the centre &ndash; should be smoothed out gently with a hand cork-rubber whilst being careful not to leave air bubbles. Finally the glued flooring should be rolled through.</p>

<h1>Joining &ndash; using hot welding process</h1>
<p>Whilst welding the floor covering, the joints are milled either manually or by machine to an adequate depth and width and the joints are cleaned of any residues. We suggest a using GraboWeld welding rod.</p>
<p>The temperature of the hot air should be set at a minimum of 300 oC. The welding can be done with automatic or hand operated equipment. Before beginning the procedure,  trial welding is necessary in order to determine an adequate temperature and speed.</p>
<p>After the welding seam has cooled down, the elimination of the surplus rod should be done in two steps. First, with the help of a quarter moon shaped knife together with the sliding tool the rod should d be cut in half and following the total cooling period the flat cutting should be done with the quarter moon shaped knife.</p>
<h1>Cleaning and maintenance</h1>
<p>The durability and permanent attractive appearance of the floor covering is influenced mainly by regular cleaning and maintenance. The cleaning frequency depends on the intensity of use according to specific routines.</p>
<p>We suggest daily cleaning and periodically a basic cleaning in order to maintain the quality of the floor covering.</p>
<p>This guide suggests some detergents, but other detergents with similar parameters produced by other manufacturer can also be used. Cleaning agents or solvents which cause damage &ndash; e.g. scratches on the surface &ndash; should not be used. </p>
<p>Generally, it is important to observe the instructions of the manufacturer and it is recommended to ask for specific advice from the manufacturing companies and to follow it.</p>
<ol><li><span class="hot">Basic cleaning</span>
<ol type="a"><li>removing solid soiling with sweeping or vacuum-cleaning</li><li>removing stubborn, sticky soiling</li></ol>
<h3>Tools</h3>
  <ul><li>strong alkaline  cleaner (basic)</li><li>one-disc scrubbing machine</li><li>water vacuum cleaner (stick scrubber and floor stripper)</li></ul>
    <p>A high performance basic detergent as an extremely quick and complete solution to the problem of residues from soiling deposits. This should be water soluble, contents solvent, tensides, disinfectants, etc.</p></li>

<h3>Technology:</h3>
<p>Distribute the solution over an area of 5-10 metres squared, scrub, absorb, then wipe off with plenty of clean water and absorb again (neutralising). We recommend basic care depending on the intensity of use. General frequency should be between six months and a year.</p>
</li>

<li><span class="hot">Daily cleaning </span>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>Removing solid soiling with sweeping or vacuum-cleaning</li>
    <li>Wet cleaning, which can be done manually or by using a machine</li>
      </ol>
<h3>Manual wet cleaning:</h3>
<p>For daily cleaning a mop and bucket as well as detergent are required. Non-ionic, alcoholic tenside can be used which preserves the original shine of the surface excellently and dries quickly. It causes no stripe formation or haziness. </p>
<p>Cleaning should be carried out using two-can-technology.</p>
<h3>Daily cleaning with machine</h3>
  <p>For daily care of the flooring, an automatic cleaning machine (both pushed and driven) can be used. It is recommended that detergent be used which contains non-ionic or cationic surfactants to ensure excellent cleaning performance and to preserve the original slip properties.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Delivery</h2>
<p>The most efficient delivery for floor covering are the 20-40 feets containers. Under adverse weather conditions when the temperature is down to -10&deg;C the products should be delivered by vehicle with well-tempered loading space. The rolls have to be placed on stands. The blank spaces can be filled up or the rolls can be fixed with bands.</p>
<p>The floor coverings can't be superposed.</p>
<h2>Storage</h2>
<p>The floor coverings for Graboplast Ltd vehicles Can be laid on all subfloors or underlays wich are sufficiently firm, free of cracks, clean, permanently dry and level. In the automobile industry the coverings are usually applied to metal or wooden (plywood, fibreboard) subfloors.</p>
<p>The sub-floor should be clean, permanently dry, free from cracks and anti-adhesion substances and of sufficient tensile and compressive strength. This should be verified by making the necessary examination and measurements.</p>
<h2>Preparation to the sub-floor</h2>
<p>The rolls should be unrolled at least 24 hours before being laid and conditioned at the temperature of use which can not be lower than + 15&deg;C.</p>
<p>Before beginning with the covering procedure, the sub-floor should be freed from dust and grease, all eventuel glue or paint remnants should be removed.</p>

<ul><li><strong>In case of absorbent sub-floors - Wooden, plywood</storng> - The allowable moisture content is 8-12 %. If staining or other treatments (with flame-retarding agents, insecticides or fungicides) of the surfaces are technologically reasonable, these procedures should be made at least one month before laying and sticking the PVC covering. (The water or solvent remaining in the surface can have a adverse effect on the adhesive, so it can adversely influence the quality of the sticking.) For making an optimally flat surface the joint gaps between the sheets and the sinking of the fixing screws should be levelled with an appropiately elastic cement.</li>
<li><strong>In case of non-absorbent sub-floors </strong></li>
<li>Metal surface - It should be free from rust and other mechanical contaminations. For getting a better bonding strength, it is required to rough the surfaces and to apply a priming layer to improve adhesion.</li>
<li>Glass fibre polyester surface</li>
</ul>

<p>The anti-adhesive substances should be removed (degreasing). Thomsit PRO 40.</p>
<h2>Cutting and laying</h2>
<p>The Grabo vehicle floor covering should be conditioned and freed from tension at site &ndash; at least a day before laying it down.</p>
<p>A sheet in lenghth of the vehicle with 5 cm allowance should be cut out of the conditioned covering material, then laid on the sub-floor. The precise tailoring should be done after that.</p>
<p>Between the adjacent sheets a gap of 1mm should be left for making the welded joints. Depending on the number of the vehicles to be covered, it is worth making a metal pattern or a die-tool for cutting the elements by which the cutting time in the vehicle can be largely reduced and a higher precision and a more aesthetically pleasing appearance can be achieved.</p>
<p>Before cementing, the spread sheet should be folded up half-way. Then the adhesive should be applied to the surface &ndash; starting from the middle &ndash; using a suitable tool (spatula, roll, spraying gun etc.).</p>

<h2>Cleaning and maintenance</h2>
<p>In order to maintain its quality, every floor covering requires proper cleaning and care. If you follow the recommended technology, the expected service life and the aesthetic appearance will be easily maintained, so the maintenance of the floor covering is cost saving over a long period of time. The modern safety floorings for vehicles require modern caring technologies. These include manual or mechanical methods with special cleaning devices or the combinations of both. The vehicles should be cleaned as a daily routine and in addition a more intense cleaning should be carried out every 3-4 weeks depending on the season and the grade of contamination. For the daily cleaning (mopping) the use of a two-bucket cleaning truck with the necessary auxiliaries is recommended. Before mopping the surface should be dedusted by sweeping or vacuuming. Then the adhered contamination will be loosened and removed by detergent containing lukewarm water using a special mopping brush, then the wash-water should be mopped up by the means of the squeezer device. Then the covering should be wiped using the pure-water mopping brush. It is very favourable to dry the covering using a wet-dry vacum-cleaner which removes the water out of the tiny holes as well. In addition the above mentioned daily maintenance, it is necessary to periodically carry out intensive cleaning of the walking surfaces. For this purpose the floor-cleaning device types ULTRA DISK or BR 400 are recommended.</p>
<p>These devices spray detergent containing water onto the surface of the floor covering while scrubbing it concentrically, then they sponge the contaminated water from the floor.</p>
<p>The contamination caused by chewing gum stuck to the floor covering is best removed with a spatula first (taking care to avoid damaging the PVC covering), and then wipe the rest with an alcohol wetted cloth.</p>

<p>Cleaning and Care Product References from ECOLAB</p>
<h2>Manual cleaning/ wet mopping</h2>
<h2>Autoscrubber -drier cleaning</h2>
<p>ATTENTION!</p>

<p>In case of anti-slip coverings it is prohibited to use oily and wax-based floor-caring materials, because it effects the function of the covering reducing its non-slip properties.</p>
<p>No paint thinners and organic solvents should be used for cleaning. Organic solvents, strong alkalis and acids and strong colouring agents (e.g. hair-dyes, inks, ballpens) may cause discolouration and damage. Articales made of coloured rubber may caused discolouration when contacting the floor surface. Burning cigarette-ends and other hot objects may cause destruction.</p>


<h2>Method of sticking adhesives, adhesive application</h2>
<p>Because of the large variety of the reception surfaces and coverings various adhesives and methods of adhesion are offered to you. The most important information is summarised in a table below.</p>
<h2>Wet adhesion</h2>
<p>It is used when sticking to absorbent sub-floors (fibreboard). The adhesive has to be applied on the sub-floor only. After the prescribed ventilation time the floor covering should be laid in the wet adhesive bed. For ensuring a good bond the covering should be smoothed carefully &ndash; starting from the middle &ndash; with the use of a roller taking care that all the air bubbles are removed. Proceed the same way with the other half of the covering.</p>
<h2>Contact sticking</h2>
<p>It is used in the case of non-absorbent surfaces (metal, glass fibre polyester etc.) The adhesive has to be applied to both surfaces (with a spatula A4 to the sup-floor and with a roll or a spatula A4 to the backside of the covering). The applied adhesive has to be totally ventilated and become yellow translucent on both surfaces. At making the finger test &ndash; after 30-60 minutes &ndash; no adhesive is allowed to coat your finger. Only after that you can start with laying down the floor covering.</p>
<p>Adhesives, adhesives applying</p>
<h2>Using a spatula</h2>
<p>It is recommended that the adhesive be aplied to the sub-floor primarily with the use of a  spatula. In this case it is required to use a spatula with toothing as specified (A3, A4).</p>
<h2>Using a roll</h2>
<p>In case of contact sticking the adhesive can be applied to the backside of the covering simply with this method. Optimal application can be reached by using a sponge roll with appropriate pores.</p>
<h2>Spraying</h2>
<p>If the contractor has a spraying gun for adhesive, the application is made easier. Only the adhesive called Thomsit K 188 E is suitable for machine application. Dilution: with water in 12-13 % by volume. In this case, however, it is especially important to carry out a trial sticking before laying the floor covering. Only in this way it is possible to set the precise blending ratio and to verify the optimal adhesive use. Of course, dilution will change the ventilation time which can be found out by making the trial sticking.</p>
<h2>Welding</h2>
<p>If it is necessary to weld the flooring, the joints shall be cut in the appropriate depth and width with a manual or machine joint-cutter and cleaned from the eventual contaminations. We recommend touse the welding cord called Graboheg which is available in a large colour scale. Welding can be accomplished with an automotive or a manual device. It is advisable to carry out first a trial welding to find the optimal temperature and speed.</p>
<p>After the welding seam has cooled down, the surplus cord will be removed in two steps. First the cord will be half-cut by the means of a slide and a moon knife, then the flushing will be done with a moon knife after absolute cooling.</p>
<h2>Choosing the welding cords</h2>
<h2>Flat welding</h2>
<p>The automobile floor covering types can be built in exclusively by welding. The welding should be done by the hot-air welding technology using welding cords of appropriate profiles. The welded joints should be slotted in the proper depth before the welding by a manual slotter or a special joint cutter.</p>
<p>Immediately after that the ready-made grooves should be cleaned thoroughly from the eventual adhesive remnants, ceramic and silicon carbide grains and other contaminants.</p>
<p>If the bonding of the floor covering is made with water based adhesive, it is recommended to carry out the slotting and welding procedures 24 hours after the covering has been finished. In case of applying solvent based contact adhesives, those procedures can be completed immediately</p>
<h2>Welding joints</h2>
<p>Welding is an important stage in the covering procedure. Welding has to ensure a totally waterproof covering for the purpose of simple cleanability and a long service life. For the welding you have to use a welding cord of proper size and shape as recommended by the manufacturer. (Graboheg &oslash; 4,5mm, I40, K 326 G)</p>
<p>The welding procedure can be carried out by manual or automatic equipment. In every case it is advisable to make a welding test on a piece of floor to set the optimal parameters (temperature and speed). The adjoining floor edges and the welding cord are required to melt sufficiently to fill in the joints and to create a safely waterproof connection.</p>
<p>After cooling, the outstanding welding cord is removed with a special knife in two steps to align the welded joint with the floor sheets. (This procedure is reasonable when using welding cords of circular cross-section only).</p>
<p>Equipment for hot-air method:</p>
<ul><li>safety knife Delphin, Green Knife</li>
<li>trimming knife</li>
<li>manual or automatic hot air welding gun</li>
<li>speedwell noozle for the welding cord</li>
</ul>
