<m3>Royal jelly</m3><h1>Royal jelly</h1>

<p>Royal jelly is a honey bee secretion that is used in the nutrition of the larvae, produced by the young workers, secreted from the hypopharnyngeal glands in their heads. This activity takes advantage of their organism.</p>
<p>Only the royal jelly made for the mother larvae (queen-bee or still a 'princess') is suitable for human consumption. Royal jelly is made of the aliment of 3-4 days old larvae.</p>
<p><img src="/images/royal_jelly_mixed_with_honey.jpg" alt="Rolay jelly" />
With a very meticulous work a very small quantity can be obtained. 3-4 cradles may provide 1 g. Royal jelly can be taken away only from a populous, strong, healthy family.
It is a highly valuable substance: the weight of the larvae in 3 days grows to 250 times of its original weight by consuming royal jelly.</p>

<p>The overall composition of royal jelly is 67% water, 12.5% crude protein including small amounts of many different amino acids (alanin, arginine, asparacemic acid, glutamine acid, cysteine, glycol, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, serine , taurine, tyrosine, valine), and 11% of simple sugar, also including a relatively high amount (5%) of fatty acids.</p>

<p>High content of vitamins and minerals: B-complex vitamins such as pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) and vitamin B6 (pyridoxine); trace elements: Fe, P, K, Ca, Cu, Si, some enzymes, antibacterial and antibiotic components, and huge amount of vitamin C.</p>

The proportion of our mix makes the royal jelly possible to be conserved, but still not harming its efficiency. Proposed quantity is 0,5 g of this mixture, taking it in the morning to an empty stomach sucking it and keeping it in the mouth for 2-5 minutes.</p>


<m3>Propolis</m3><h1>Propolis</h1>

<p>Bee tar or propolis is the caulking or sticking material gathered from the resinous substance of the plants, from the sticky secretion of buds. This substance is used for stopping up the splitting of the beehive and for covering surface roughnesses and strange residues.</p>
<p>The most important components are the flavonoids, volatile oils, vitamins and minerals: K, Na, Mg, Al, P, Si, Va, Co, S, Ni, Zn.

<h2>Grapes for white wines:</h2>

<h3>Ezerjó ('a 1000 good things')</h3>
<p>A plain wine with plenty of assertive and crips acids. Greenish white colour, dry, low on aroma. It ages well in the region of Mór. ('móri ezerjó' is well-known)</p>


<h3>Furmint</h3>
<p>Yellow with some greenish tints, ripe apple aroma. After aging in wood barrels it can develop an aroma of walnut and honey. Rich in extract and high in sugar content.  It requires aging to make a robust wine with accented acids. The main regions are Tokaj-Hegyalja and Somló where the taste of the terroir gives a special bouquet. Excellent ingredient for dessert wine but the dry Furmint is also worth to taste.</p>

<h3>Hárslevelû ('linden-leaf')</h3>
<p>Fruity light aroma with a greenish yellow colour. Faintly spicy on the palate. It could offer more elegant acids than Furmint. Some tartness can be tasted in the finish. Typical grape of Tokaj-Hegyalja, Somló and Eger region.</p>

<p>With female flowers this kind of grape is difficult to set and grow. The new wine is pale green and it remains light even with aging. It has a firm but unobstrusive bouquet, and an overall character similar to Királyleányka.   </p>
<p>After prolonged aging the vigorous acids attain magnificent harmony.</p>

<h3>Budai zöld ('Buda green')</h3>
<p>The number one pollenizer of Kéknyelû, unique to Badacsony. In its pure version it makes a harsh but not complex wine, similar to Ezerjó.</p>

<m2>Essential oil and Aromatherapy</m2><h1>Essential oil and natural products for cosmetics and aromatherapy</h1>

<h2>Important things to know about essential oils and normal oils</h2>
<p>Scents of nature is everywhere around us. Essential oils are mainly responsible for the characteristic scents and fragrance of flowers, fruits, leaves and roots. Essential oils can be found in any parts of an aromatic plant. The essential oil content of aromatic plants is generally between 1-6% however it can reach a higher or less amount.</p>
<p><img src="/images/essential_oil_n.jpg" alt="Essential oil and Aromatherapy" />Essential oils are made of balsam or a part of a plant by using vapour distillation, or in special cases pleasant fragranced liquid extract gotten from solvent extraction or cold pressing, or rarely can be found solid. Essential oils can vary in their texture due to air or lights. The chemical content and characteristics can perform different properties. The oil production and the storage of the plants are done within GMP conditions. The quality of the essential oils meets the European Medicine Book's standards and has got the certificate signed by the Research Institute of Herbal Medicines.</p>
<p>Essential oils can be used together with base oils. Base oils have important role in aromatherapy as a transfer material, moreover can perform good medical effects on human health. The base oils are mostly made of greasy oils, in other name cold pressed. The texture of the base oils are totally different from the essential ones. Base oils are consumed by eating foods that contain base oils , however they can also be absorbed through the skin.</p>
<h2>Characteristics</h2>
<p>Essential oils are produced by steam distillation, cold pressing, solvent and enzyme extraction depending on the nature of aromatic plants. It is the best to use essential oils (except lavender oil) in diluted form due to their high concentration and potential irritation or damage that they can cause. Essential oils are volatile; this feature draws the distinction between essential and base or carrier oils (e.g. sweet almond, jojoba, olive oils). Essential oils are light-sensitive, heat-labile so they should always be stored in a cool place away from light and heat.</p>
<h2>Effect of essential oils</h2>
<ul>
<li>antimicrobial effect (inhibits the growth of bacteria and fungi)</li>
<li>effects on respiratory organs - several essential oils are secreted through the lungs and promote the removal of mucus from the respiratory system.</li>
<li>effects on digestive system (many internally used oils produce antispasmodic, carminative and stomachic effects, while several oils used externally have mild antispasmodic effect)</li>
<li>due to rubefacient effects of some essential oils the use of massage oils containing this type of oils dilates the capillaries, increases the blood circulation and the intensity of pain might be decreased.</li>
<li>effects on urinary tract (antibacterial, anti-inflammatory etc.)</li>
<li>relaxing effect</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fields of Application</h2>
<ul>
<li>Medicine Industry</li>
<li>Cosmetic Industry</li>
<li>Aromatherapy</li>
</ul>
<p>Their fields of application can be varied from Health Care to Natural Medicine and cosmetics. They also play basic role in healthy eating (food consumption). Spice oils can help our food to be tasty and moreover can help in digestion and other biological vital process.</p>
<p>Essential oils are also ingredients for body lotions, beauty and perfume products. Cosmetic industry uses aromatic plants and essential oils to produce high quality cosmetic products. There is only a thin line between aromatherapy, cosmetic and medicine industry.</p>

<h2>Aromatherapy (Mixing essential oils)</h2>

<p>The introduction of aromatherapy in Hungary began in the early 1990's. First the essential oils business started to grow, later new expectations and demand increased on the Hungarian market for cosmetics, air freshener oils, sauna oils were also introduced. Constant developments performed that the range of products has widened. At present new products has been also introduced on the market like bath and massage oils, natural cosmetics. The products mentioned above are sold by trade shops, store chains, drug-stores, and an even widening number of hotels and hotel chains, spas.

<m3>Royal jelly</m3><h1> Royal jelly</h1>

<p>Royal jelly is a honey bee secretion that is used in the nutrition of the larvae, produced by the young workers, secreted from the hypopharnyngeal glands in their heads. This activity takes advantage of their organism.</p>
<p><img src="/images/royal_jelly_mixed_with_honey_n.jpg" alt="Royal jelly mixed with oney" />Only the royal jelly made for the mother larvae (queen-bee or still a 'princess') is suitable for human consumption. Royal jelly is made of the aliment of 3-4 days old larvae.</p>
<p>With a very meticulous work a very small quantity can be obtained. 3-4 cradles may provide 1 g. Royal jelly can be taken away only from a populous, strong, healthy family.</p>
<p>It is a highly valuable substance: consuming royal jelly the weight of the larvae in 3 days grows to 250 times of its original weight.</p>

<p>The overall composition of royal jelly is 67% water, 12.5% crude protein including small amounts of many different amino acids (alanin, arginin, asparacemic acid, glutamine acid, cysteine, glycol, izoleucin, leucin, fenilalanin, serin , taurin, tyrosine, valin), and 11% simple sugars, also including a relatively high amount (5%) of fatty acids.</p>

<m2>Mangalitza pork</m2><h1>Mangalitza pork</h1>

<p>Homeland of the Mangalitza was the territory of the former Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy.In the past Mangalitza was kept because of its bacon and lard, nowadays the hams and cutlets are more popular.</p>
<p>Hungarian Mangalitza has a robust body and powerful legs, its curly 'coat' adapts easily to extreme weather conditions and needs to be kept in a wide landscape to be able to move freely. Resistant to diseases.
Mangalitza meat is a popular pork for Hungarian sausages, its juicy, delicious meat makes   dishes so excellent.
</p>

<m2>Hungarian gray cattle</m2><h1>Hungarian gray cattle</h1>

<p>By now it is proved that the meat of the grey cattle kept/raised among natural circumstances is rich in iron and vitamins and its flavour is special.</p>
<p>Dishes made of gray cattle have been prepared based on recipes protected for centuries.</p>
<p>These meals were made traditionally by cowboys of Hortobágy region, by firemen of Kiskunság region, by housewives of Sárköz or by master cooks. Gray cattle dishes are the parts of our national heritage already: a treasure to be transmitted to the future.</p>


<m2>Hungarian duck</m2><h1>Hungarian duck</h1>

<p>The Hungarian duck can be fattened and stuffed especially well. Its meat is exceptionally tasty, succulent and it has a delicate fibre substance. This is a very resistent type and a good aliment explorer.</p>
<p>There are some individuals in a smaller quantity in Transylvania and in the boondocks of the Hungarian Plain. </p>
<p>Its liver, its fat, its cracklings are real delicacy. The liver and the cracklings of the fattened duck are specialities, real Hungaricums.</p>

<m2>Hungarian truffle</m2><h1>Hungarian truffle</h1>

<p>Truffles in Hungary are mentioned first by a story around 1540, where the Trencsén judge orders the preservation of a truffle yielding beech forest. In the cookbooks of the 1700s and 1800s we can find several truffle dish recipies, which were taken over even by the French cookbooks as well!</p>

<p>During these centuries Truffle was the European mansions' requested delicacy, harvested by the so called truffle-hunters who belong to the mansions staff.
Truffle became increasingly more popular in the blooming economy of the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy. The Hungarian truffle wholesalers carried tons of truffle on their cart to the Vienna market. In the first place the so called 'white truffle' (Choiromyces meandriformis).</p>


<p>The socialist social-political system following the World War two leaded to the mutilation of the gastronomy in Hungary, wiped the truffle out from the common knowledge once for all. The technical literature knows one single man, Szemere László a 73 years old jurist, who started studying the subterranean mushrooms.</p>

<p>His researches were followed by editing some technical books, but all those could be published only in German language , like other studies of him. Towards the end of his life he  finally managed to create plantations as well, but the social-political system did not make him possible to pass his knowledge on.</p>

<p>In the years following the social-political system transformation the interest toward truffle slowly revived, more and more people started to harvest truffle by pleasure. First groups were the circle of friends but then the First Hungarian Truffle Assiciation was born as well. Next step was to borrow Italian truffle specialize dogs  and learn dog-searching as well.</p>

<p>Today already the most distinguished master cookers &mdash; World and European champion cookers &mdash; join the association in order to get involved to the history of truffle by using the technical literature of the past centuries.</p>
<p>Based on a decennial work we can say that the following types are typical in the Carpatian Basin.</p>

<p>The two most important truffle classes are the summer truffle (T. aestivum) and the white truffle (Choiromyces meandriformis). 
Important kinds are furthermore the autumn variety of the summer truffle (T. uncinatum) and the characteristic fragrance variety (T. mesentericum).</p>


<p>One of the important variants of the summer truffle is the coumarin fragrance truffle of the siccating soil plain oak groves or on the Eastern Transylvania we can find delicate and flat peridium truffle. 
Among black truffles the big spore truffle (T. macrosporum) is important which grows rather in the well water supplied forests, providing  an excellent, stable fragrance; or the winter truffle (T. brumale), the one that grows mainly in the southern part of the country .</p>

<p>The arenicolous truffle (Terfezia terfezioies) grows in the Hungarian acacia forests. 
The Istria truffle ( T. magnatum) can be found in the so called gallery forests running among rivers standing under a submediterranean micro-climate effect.</p>

<p>In the Hungarian gastronomy we use diversely the various kinds: for lettuces and for soups the Hungarian master cookers like the white truffle; for roasts and fish they use the black truffle; the most important ones are the winter and the big spore truffle. 
For sweets till now we discovered the arenicolous and the red truffle (Melanogaster).</p>

<p>The aim of the qualified professionals dealing with the truffle is that the Hungarian truffle art became known again by Europe and all around the world getting back the old rank and reputation.</p>


<m2>Hungarian apple</m2><h1>Hungarian apple</h1>

<m2>Hungarian Pálinka brandy</m2><h1>Hungarian 'Pálinka' brandy</h1>

<p>The savouriest brandy brands can be found in the Carpathian Basin, where the flavour of brandies made of friuts is unique all around the world. This is not that surprising if we consider that the clime of the Hungarian Plain is definitly favourable for growing friuts, specially for the apricot, the plum, the cherry, the strawberry and the pear.</p>

<m2>Hungarian paprika</m2><h1>Hungarian paprika</h1>

<p>Where does paprika come from, there are several answers to this question: comes from slopes of the Himalayas, Columbus brought it to Europe from Amerika with the potato, originates from Central Amerika or it was grown in India first&hellip;</p>
<p>Charles Gundel, one of the biggest personalities of the Hungarian gastronomy states that Spanish pimiento paprika arrived with Columbus indeed, but the Hungarian capsicum paprika got to us from India , via Persia by Turkish people in the sixteenth century. This theory seems true since paprika has been titled as 'Indian pepper' for centuries.</p>

<p>Paprika is not simply a spice for the Hungarian gastronomy, but it is an organic part of that because of its special, unique aroma, and its beautiful colour.</p>


<p>In Hungary mainly in the southern regions circumstances for growing paprika are perfect The daily average temperature, the quantity of the sunshine and moisture are all suitable. The most famous Hungarian paprika producer cities are Szeged, Kalocsa and Szentes.</p>

<p>Quite a lot scientists dealt with paprika in connection with its effects to the human organism. Professor Albert Szent-Györgyi&mdash;a Hungarian physiologist who won the Nobel Prize in 1937&mdash;discovered  that there is no other friut or vegetable which contains that much C-vitamin like paprika does. Its C-vitamin content is five times bigger then in lemon or in orange.</p>

<p>In the 1950s nobody knew how to make the paprika less spicy. In 1959 brothers Pálffy made a historical discovery in the city of Szeged, they realized that if they remove the veins from the paprika its sharpness comes to an end. With this method they invented something brand new: the Szeged Noble Sweet Paprika. The newly tamed paprika created a sensation and became popular all around the world.</p>


<p>The Hungarian paprika producers managed to improve a variety which remain sweet even if seeds and veins are not removed. Currently there are five kinds of paprika milling on the market: the delicacy, the noble sweet, the semi-sweet, the rose and the hot pepper.</p>

<m2>Hungarian porcelain manufacture</m2><h1>The story of the Hungarian porcelain manufactory</h1>

<p>The Meissen porcelain factory was established in  January 1710 by Ágost Erõs. 
In the initial period only few statues were produced in Meissen. Gottlob Kirchner sculptor first made clock holders, candlesticks, modeled some bathroom pools, and a large size animal figures were made as well, even he prepared a  one metre tall figure of apostle Paul for the Japán Palace.</p>


<p>The Hungarian porcelain production started relatively late, only in the 19th century.</p>

<p>One of the most considerable Hungarian porcelain factories is  the Herend porcelain manufactory founded in the era of the development of the national independency, of the development  of the Hungarian bourgeois mentality; it was founded by Vince Stingl ceramist in 1826. The popular products of the factory were generally of the baroque and the Empire style.</p>
<p>From 1839 the new proprietor of the firm was Mór Fischer, who was full of new ideas, and ambition. He  took up the production of the artistic porcelain: at this era appeared the so called Saxon bouquet with several compositions of garden and wild flowers, painted with natural coloration.</p>

<p>The tulip bunch was the next important product. The First Hungarian Industry Art Exhibition, the Vienna Exhibition in 1845, the 1st London World Exhibition in 1851 the New York Exhibition in 1853, the Paris Exhibition in 1855 brought the highest reputation for Herend. An outstanding creation of the Manufactury was the large size scene dish, with the title' Vitam et Sanguinem' which was awarded on the London Expo in 1862.</p>

<p>After a few years of recession a booming started in 1896 with the appearance of a new owner Eugene Farkasházy, the founder's grandchild. Based on his foreign country experiences revived the old traditions and enriched the product range with novelties as well.</p>
<p>The grand prize of the Paris Expo in 1900 and of the Saintpetersburg exhibition in1901 justified his endeavours.  Between the two world wars he continued to reproduce the traditional Mór Fischer forms and in the meantime based on the considerable creation of the contemporary sculptors they started to produce Hungarian figures as well.</p>

<p>Herendi Manufaktúra got into a state possession in 1948, it was privatized in 1993. Since then the 75% has been in property of the employees. The mission of the Manufactory: the Herend Porcelain Manufactory Co. has to keep its position of producing luxtury porcelain in munufactural way, in excellent quality, curing industrial art and historical industrial tradition, operating as a profitable enterprise, being always a forefront manufactury which ensures the job for its employees on long term.</p>
